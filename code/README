As the LCS itself is not up and running yet, there is currently no Makefile.
However, there is a Makefile for the tests in the /tests directory. If you
wish to compile anything in this directory, you must use the C++11 standard
(-std=c++11). I have not tried later standards, but imagine that they would
work as well. Earlier standards certainly do not.
