Kwon11.pdf
The paper we used to find validated CRMs.

Su10.pdf
A review paper of CRM detection methods.

Berman02.pdf
Discusses how high local density of TFBSs might be used to predict CRMs.

Schroeder04.pdf
Discusses how CRMs are frequently composed of a cluster of similar binding sites.

Gompel05.pdf
Shows that the destruction of different regulatory elements in a CRM
can lead to the same morphological change.

Rajewsky02.pdf
One of the earlier attempts at a CRM predictor, but I'm not sure why I
saved this one, perhaps I'll know more when I re-read it.

Blanchette06.pdf
A genome wide prediction of CRMs.

Li07.pdf
A study of CRM characteristics.

One thing they report is that clustering, especially homotypic clustering is a
feature of a subclass of CRMs.

Wagner99.pdf
Addresses the fact that TFBSs are unlikely to cluster by chance.

Halfon08.pdf
REDfly, which contains the largest collection of annotated, validated CRMs.

Hardison12.pdf
Contains review of major methods for CRM prediction, especially epigenetic features, which may have more predictive power than other methods.

Loo09.pdf
Contains a review of methods for CRM prediction.

Jeziorska09.pdf
Contains background info on CRMs from a systems biology point of view.
