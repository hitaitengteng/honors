INTRODUCTION

Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the expression of genes by
binding to particular locations on our DNA. Typically, a single gine will
be regulated by a *group* of transcription factors. *Cis-regulatory module*
is the fancy name we use to refer to the set of sites where a group of TFs
will bind.

My research this summer focused on developing a program to infer the
location and composition of CRMs using the principle of conservation
across evolutionary time. In essence, it examines genetic sequences from
a number of species possessing the same gene of interest and looks for
similarities in the regions near that gene in each species. The
idea is that if we see similar groupings of transcription factor binding
sites in these regions across different species, it could be that they
have been conserved because those sites work together to perform some
important regulatory function for that gene.

Determining where and in what
combination transcription factors are likely to bind is a vital step
toward improving our understanding of genetic disease and of gene
regulation more broadly.

MATERIALS & METHODS

Relative to those of the physical sciences, the tools of a computer
scientist are few; all of the code was written on my laptop in the C
programming language, and all genetic data was sourced from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website.

The program itself uses genetic algorithms --- a problem-solving approach
from artificial intelligence based loosely on biological evolution.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Many thanks are owed to my advisor, Clare Congdon, for her continued
support and instruction; to Craig Lessard for his help in understanding
the biology; to the other members of the Congdon lab for their wisdom
and guidance; and to the INBRE and Surdna foundations for funding this
research.
