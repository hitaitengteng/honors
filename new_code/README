To run, type "make", then:

classify <training set file> <test set file> <quantiles file>

Note: All files must be in CSV format, and the training and testing files
      must have headers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will also notice that there is a directory ("r_scripts") containing
three R scripts.

shuffle_inputs.r: Given a CSV file containing inputs, randomizes the order
of those inputs. A lot of times, data will be organized by the class
attribute, which isn't particularly helpful for generating rules. To run,
simply type:

	Rscript shuffle_inputs.r <input file> <output file>

two_fold_split.r: This does the same thing as shuffle_inputs.r, except it
splits the input file into a training set and a test set. To run, type:

	Rscript two_fold_split.r <input file> <training set output file> <test set output file>

make_quantiles.r: Creates a user-specified number of quantiles, based on
a given data set and class attribute value. To run, type:

	Rscript make_quantiles.r <data file> <output file> <number of quantiles> <class attribute value>
