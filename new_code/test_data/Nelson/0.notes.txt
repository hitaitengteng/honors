Files in this folder:
1. one xlsx file, from March 17, 2016, from Erik

2. three csv versions of that
   a. Nelson.160317.withFert.csv -- xlsx converted to csv
   b. Nelson.v2.fert.csv -- with / in header names removed
   c. Nelson.v2.csv -- a mystery, meaning that the relevant xlsx file is no
                       longer in the same directory on my computer
   d. Just added:
      ForClarewitFert.160208.xlsx, which might or might not be what
                                   Nelson.v2.csv derived from

3. reformat.v8b.R
   v8 of this R program was the last one I worked with
   ... but I failed to update all the comments
   So 8b is with comments updated for you (and for me, in the future)


4. The folder 0.Data, which has the 8 * 2 ARFF files output from the R program
   (and which we moved forward with), I think.
