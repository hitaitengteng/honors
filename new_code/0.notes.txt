1. First Fitness: rules are ranked by odds ratio. Odds ratio is given by

	(TP x TN) / (FP x FN)

   TP: true positives; an example counts as a true positive for a rule
       if the rule's condition matches the example AND it correctly
       classifies it.
   TN: true negatives; an example counts as a true negative for a rule
       if neither the rule's condition nor its predicted class matches
       those of the example.
   FP: false positives; an example counts as a false positive for a rule
       if the rule's condition matches the example, but the rule does
       NOT correctly classify it.
   FN: false negatives; an example counts as a false negative for a rule
       if the rule's condition does NOT match the example, but the the
       class predicted by the rule does match.

   For each rule, we iterate over the examples and compute its fitness
   using odds ratio. This computation determines a ranking of the rules.

2. Second fitness: also uses odds ratio, but the computation is a bit
   different. For each example, only the fittest rule that correctly
   classifies that example gets credit for it. "Credit" in this
   instance means counting the example as a true positive only for
   that rule?

   This is the fitness that drives the GA.

3. The GA runs every iteration.

4. The number of iterations is specified as a parameter?
