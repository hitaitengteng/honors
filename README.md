# An Investigation of Genetics-Based Machine Learning as Applied to Global Crop Yields
### An Honors Paper for the Department of Computer Science

This repository contains all of my senior thesis work, code and datasets
included. The project investigates environmental and economic factors impacting
global and regional crop yields from 1975 through 2007 using my own 
Michigan-style Learning Classifier System (LCS).

The latest version of the code and the classifier results can be found in the
new_code directory; the raw data can be found in the Datasets directory; and
the thesis itself can be found in the Thesis directory.
