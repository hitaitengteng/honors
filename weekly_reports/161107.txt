Week of 11/7/16
Will Gantt

This week:

I finished reading Ryan's survey paper on LCSs and found a number of other
helpful resources in his bibliography. I have also been making progress on
"Chapter 2", having completed the section that overviews EAs, and part of
the section on GBML and on the problem my project is addressing. Lastly,
having gotten the go-ahead from Clare, I have been spending some time
learning the various components of EOlib -- the codebase that I will be
using to design my program.

Next week:

I hope to finish writing Chapter 2, and to continue learning the codebase 
(and perhaps beginning to genuinely manipulate it, though there are enough
other things on my plate this week that I may not get to that). I also
hope to read more of the sources I found from Ryan's bibliography.
