Week of 11/14/16
Will Gantt

This week:

I mostly finished with a rough draft of Chapter 2, but had to get 
Clare's input on a couple of things in order to finish it up. I
ended up including more background information that I had originally
planned and so it's longer than I intended. I know that it will likely
need considerable revision and that some of it can be cut.

Clare and I have not succeeded in resolving the compilation issues with
EOlib, but Clare has requested Stephen Houser's help. Hopefully, he will
be able to work it out so that I can start working with the code later
this coming week.

Next week:

I hope to get feedback from Clare on Chapter 2 and to talk to her about
a gameplan for winter break. As mentioned above, I also hope that Stephen
will be able to figure out the EOlib stuff so that I can get to work on
implementation.
