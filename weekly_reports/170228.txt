Week of 2/28/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I completed *an* implementation of the LCS. I ran it on the Iris and Wine datasets
from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Initially, it looked as though the system
was not performing any better than chance. However, I discovered a bug in a function
used to evaluate the testing data that was responsible for part of that apparent
poor performance. After I fixed it, the system still didn't do great, but it started
to exhibit greater than 50% accuracy.

In our meeting, we discussed an alternative fitness schema that would allow the rules
to "communicate" more in their evolution. By assigning credit to just one rule per
input, the system would eliminate redundancies and encourage greater coverage of
inputs across the rule set.

I have spent the latter portion of this week thinking about how best to integrate
this new schema into the LCS, and I think I need to clear up a few more things
with you before I can feel confident moving forward.

Next week:

is the last week before spring break. I have a number of other assignments and
projects due in my other classes, but I will continue trying to improve the
accuracy of the system. As mentioned above, though, I think my ability to make
good progress in this regard is contingent on me meeting with you once more.
