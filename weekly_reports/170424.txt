Week of 4/24/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I figured out why I obtained different results using the holdout method
than with the ten-fold cross validation. It turned out that the way I was
doing the holdout method was not resulting in a perfect partition of the
data, and so some of the same examples ended up in both training and test
sets, which yielded artificially high accuracy on the latter. Consequently,
I have omitted the results of the holdout tests from my thesis. However,
I performed enough cross validations to feel confident about what I have.

The remainder of the week I have devoted to writing and editing the last
two sections of my thesis (which describe the experimental setup and the
results). There is so much to say. I had originally hoped to get you a
complete draft today, but was unable to despite my best efforts. I will
get it to you either by tomorrow or Wednesday. I either was never informed 
or else completely forgot that theses are due to the department a week before 
presentations. My plan had been to submit a full draft to you a week before it 
was due to the department, but clearly that is no longer possible. I'm sorry.

Next week:

I will finish writing, submit my draft first to you, and then to the
department. I will also prepare for my defense on Thursday of next week.
