Week of 3/27/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I modified your R script for manipulating Erik's data so that it would output
CSV files in the format that my program expects, and then used the modified
script to create all of the necessary files.

I ran just a few of these through the LCS with (once again) mixed results.
The system seems to do a really good job of avoiding false positives, but it
identified less than half of the true positives, which is obviously very
problematic. 

Finally, I began writing. I have written essentially all of the section on
the system design, but it still needs some editing and a few figures before
I'll feel comfortable submitting it to you for revisions. I have also begun
to write the Background section.

Next week:

I will continue to devote most of my time to the writing, but will spend
some of it tinkering with the code to improve the true positive ID rate.
I plan to have the System Design and Background sections complete by this
time next week (at the latest). Hopefully, I will have begun writing the
introduction as well.
