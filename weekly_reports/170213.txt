Week of 2/13/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I continued writing tests and debugging using Valgrind, but still have not
addressed all of the bugs that need debugging. I did not get to devote as
many hours to the project this week as I would have liked for several
reasons, none of which I will bore you with.

In my roadmap for the semester, today was the day I had hoped to have
a first functional version of the LCS up and running, which clearly has
not come to fruition. I expected this would be the case, and intended the
due date mostly as a motivator for myself. More realistically, with the
other assignments I have on the docket at the moment, I hope to have it
done by the end of next wee.

I meant to note in my previous entry that the schema for the LCS, which
I originally wrote up in Crisp_LCS_Schema.txt (in the "write_ups_etc"
directory) is no longer completely accurate. My plan is to make the
necessary corrections once I have finished with the initial coding.

Next week:

Finish writing tests and debugging.
