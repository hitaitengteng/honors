Week of 9/19/16
Will Gantt 


This week:
  
Since last Friday, I have finished my literature search. I determined that
of the 18 papers I found that seemed like they might be relevant, only 10
of them (excluding the GAMI-CRM paper) were in fact pertinent. I ran a
second search to see whether I may have missed any papers of interest the
first time around, but found nothing. Clare did notify me, though, that the
GAMI-CRM paper had just been cited in a new publication, which I then
added to my list.

I also wrote a rough draft of each of the sections of my poster, found 
appropriate graphics, and set up an appointment to print my poster on 
Monday. I am currently awaiting feedback from Clare on the content before 
finalizing the layout.

It's worth mentioning that I chose to omit the terms "cis-regulatory module"
and "transcription factor binding site in my poster. I felt that the level
of detail to which a poster lends itself was not great enough to merit
using anything more precise than "regulatory element." Clare will have to
be the judge of this.

Lastly, I read and took notes on Jeff's original review paper, and am now
beginning to do the same for the other 10 papers I found. 
 

Next week:

I will...

  - Finish putting together my poster and print it out.
  - Continue reading and taking notes on the papers I collected.
  - Begin preparing the talk I will give to the department after fall
    break.
  - (Possibly) go back over my code from the summer. (I did look over some,
    though not all of it at the beginning of the semester. I anticipate
    having a lot going on this week in my other classes, so I'm not sure
    that I will actually get to this.)
