Week of 10/31/16
Will Gantt

This week:

I ran some trial runs on Erik's data using Weka and gained some
familiarity with the software. In my meeting with Clare on Wednesday,
we:

  1. Decided that BioHEL is too complicated to be worth trying to
     learn and do test runs on.
  2. Discussed, in broad strokes, how Erik's data would be best
     represented in a GBML system. Specifically, we talked about:
       - Whether to represent the data in its raw form (that is,
         crop yields by country by year), or in the form of deltas
         (that is, the *change* in yields by country from year to
         year). It seems that the latter may be the more promising
         route.
       - Whether to make the class attribute (change in yield or
         yield/hectare, depending on the above) discrete or continuous.
       - How a ruleset might be implemented. Considerations included
         whether to use a Pitt or Michigan approach (though it sounds
         like all of Clare's experience has been with Michigan), and
         alternative data structures to a bit string.
       - How to evaluate the fitness of a rule. Clare advocated
         strongly for odds ratio.
  3. Talked about finding an alternative codebase to GENESIS. This is
     largely motivated by GENESIS's exclusive use of bit strings as
     the means of representing solutions.
  4. Came up with a very general outline for writing "Chapter 2" ---
     the 5-10-page paper that honors folks have to write that
     describes their project in some detail.

Since our meeting, I have found a possible alternative codebase and
have been reading Ryan Urbanowicz's paper surveying LCSs. I have also
begun to compose Chapter 2, but am waiting for input from Clare on
structure.

Next week:

I intend to finish Ryan's paper, to continue writing Chapter 2, and, if
Clare decides that the codebase I have found is worth using, to start
learning how it works.
