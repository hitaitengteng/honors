Week of 10/10/16
Will Gantt 

This week:
  
The majority of my work this week was spent on finishing up my poster for
the President's Summer Research Symposium, which I believe is on the 21st.
I also spent a fair amount of time putting together my presentation for the
department. Unfortunately, I had so much else to tend to this week that I
didn't have as much time to prepare for it as I would have liked, and that
was, I think, reflected in my delivery. Lastly, I read an additional paper
for my literature review and took detailed notes.

(forgot to mention above that I also got my poster printed at the Copy
and Print Center.)

Next week:

Although I have a considerable amount of work for my other classes this
week, I intend to continue reading and taking notes on papers this week
and writing summaries as time permits.
