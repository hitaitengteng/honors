Week of 11/14/16
Will Gantt

This week:

I did not manage to finish Chapter 2, as I had hoped, but did make
significant progress on it. I found and read a number of helpful
sources on LCSs and the varieties of learning -- information that I
incorporated in my writing. I also tried to run the Evolving Objects
(EO) code, but ran into a number of difficulties compiling. Clare and
I talked about this when we met on Wednesday, and she told me to put
the code in my directory on Dover for her to look at, which I have now
done.

Next week:

I hope to resolve the compilation issues with EO and to begin working
seriously with the code. I also intend to finish Chapter 2.
