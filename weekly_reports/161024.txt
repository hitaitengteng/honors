Week of 10/24/16
Will Gantt 

This week:
  
I continued reading through the resources that Clare gave me last week.
In our meeting on Wednesday, we discussed next steps and determined these
to be the following:

	1. Experiment with Weka (decision tree classifier software) and
	   BioHEL (a GBML classifier) using Erik's data. (We got
	   permission from him this week to use his data).
	2. Develop a schedule for the next two months, with the goal of
	   producing something by the end of December.

So far, I have been doing (1), but have not gotten to (2). I think it
would be best for me to meet with Clare once more before trying to lay
out a plan.

Clare also spoke with Steve this week to ask about getting approval for
changing the focus of my project, and it sounds like Steve said to just
go ahead with it.

Next week:

I hope to meet with Clare at some point this week to hash out a gameplan
for the next two months. I also hope to have done some Weka runs on
Erik's data, and perhaps some runs on BioHEL too (if I can figure it out).
