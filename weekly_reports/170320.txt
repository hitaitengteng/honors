Week of 3/20/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I finished all major revisions to the code, including alterations to the
rule representation schema. I have made it so that all attributes---and not
just the class attribute---may be discretized into an arbitrary number of
quantiles.

I ran the LCS on the iris and wine data sets from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository with interesting results. It performs very well on the iris data
(as one would hope), and seems to do reasonably well on the wine data on most
runs. Occasionally, however, it will do abysmally, generating an extroardinarily
large number of false positives. I'm still trying to figure out why this might
be.

Next week:

I have not gotten around to running the LCS on Erik's data because I need to
make a few small transformations to the files you've given me in order for
the program to be able to read them properly. This will be one of my goals
for next week.

Additionally, I will continue to try to figure out why the program periodically
returns large numbers of false positives (at least on the wine data set). I
also hope to talk to you about further ways of improving the system (perhaps
during our meeting this week, if we have one.)

Lastly, the program is pretty slow. In the interest of getting the code on its
feet as soon as possible, I did not pay as much attention to efficiency as I 
might have. It may be the case that making improvements in this regard just
isn't something I have time for at this point, but I'll keep it in the back
of my mind.
