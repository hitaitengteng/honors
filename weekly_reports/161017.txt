Week of 10/17/16
Will Gantt 

This week:
  
After having a minor crisis early in the week about the focus of my project, I spoke
with Clare and we decided, in effect, to start over on something entirely different.
Right now, that something looks like it will be a genetics-based machine learning (GBML)
approach to studying changes in global (and local) crop yields using data collected by
Erik Nelson in the Economics department. Clare sent me a paper that she co-authored with
Erik that treats of the same data, but that employs a different methodology. She also
sent me several other resources on GBML. I have read through at least some of all of these,
spending the most time with the paper and with the over of GBML techniques written by
Tim Kovacs.

Today (Friday), I also presented my poster at the President's Summer Research Symposium.

Next week:

I will continue reading through the sources Clare has given me, will try to hash out a
concrete schedule for the remainder of the semester, and will hopefully get the approval
of the rest of the department to switch topics.
