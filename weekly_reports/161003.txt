Week of 10/7/16
Will Gantt 


This week:
  
Nearly all of my week was devoted to reading. I read two papers and part of
a third and took notes on each. I spent considerably more time on one of
these than on either of the other two, mostly because of the level of
difficulty. However, I hope to increase my pace in the future. I also wrote
an outline of the talk I will be giving to the department next week and
began putting it together in more detail.

Next week:

I have a lot to do in the coming week (and not just for my honors project).
My goals, in no particular order, are the following:

  1. Continue reading and taking notes on the papers I collected.
  2. Compile notes into a reasonably coherent document that I can present
     to the department, along with my poster, as evidence of my work thus
     far.
  3. Print out my poster.
  4. Prepare my talk.
