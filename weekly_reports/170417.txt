Week of 4/10/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I made some final changes to the code and began testing. In our meeting,
we discussed a few possible improvements:

	1. Use the *log* of the odds ratio when computing the fitness
	   in order to avoid having rules with excessively high fitnesses.
	2. Use rank-based fitness for the same purpose.
	3. Implement an operator that periodically creates new rules
	   directly from training examples.

I experimented with all three of these. Using the log of the odds ratio
provided a significant improvement, but rank-based fitness actually
diminished the system's performance, and the new operator made no
difference. Thus, in the final version of the code, the only one of
these changes that is implemented is the first.

I have now done tests on all of Erik's data, as well as the Iris and
Wine data sets (just for a performance benchmark), using the HPC.
Specifically, I have run two kinds of test: 1) a simple holdout
method that splits a data into one training and one test set, and
2) a ten-fold cross validation (but only on Erik's data). I would have
expected the ten-fold cross validation to yield better results, but
it was in the holdout that the system performed the best (and by a
considerable margin). I don't know what to make of this. I have,
of course, also taken data on the system's performance on the
training sets, where it does quite well in both cases.

I have just today begun writing up my findings.

(side note: I also made some good improvements to runtime.)

Next week:

I will finish writing up the results and submit a complete draft
to you for revision.
