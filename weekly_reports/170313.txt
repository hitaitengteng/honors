Week of 3/13/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I have devoted all of my time this week to continuing to rework
the code. I have made good progress---things seem to be going faster
than I expected.

I have been emailing with you back and forth this week with some
specific implementation questions, and you have answered them very
promptly, which has been an enormous help.

I have restructured the fitness schema to include two fitness values
for every rule (one used to establish an initial ranking of the rules,
and another that actually drives the evolution). I have also rewritten 
the selection function; made new functions for evaluating the two 
fitnesses; and new functions for initializing a random population of 
rules with sensible starting values.

The major thing I'm trying to work out at the moment is the attribute
representation. In the old system, the range of values covered by a
rule for a single attribute was denoted by a center and a spread.
In an email, you suggested discretizing values for all attributes
(not just the class attribute) in the interest of narrowing the
search space. In the interest of time as well, this seems like a good
way to go.

Next week:

As you said, the rule representation I end up choosing will
inform the choice and behavior of the genetic operators I implement.
My goal for the next week is to decide on that representation, 
implement the operators, and have something up and running by
the time classes resume.
