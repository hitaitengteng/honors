Week of 11/28/16
Will Gantt

This week:

I made some final edits to Chapter 2 and submitted it to Clare. Stephen
succeeded in fixing the compilation issues we were having with EOlib
on Dover. I have been trying to work through the accompanying tutorial,
but have encountered some troubles with include paths, which I am
trying to work out.

Next week:

I hope to resolve the problems I've run into with the tutorial and to
talk to Clare about what to do over winter break.
