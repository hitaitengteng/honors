Week of 1/30/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I have continued work on implementing my LCS. Last week, I mentioned
some concerns about certain design choices. Some of these seem to
have come back to bite me, and I am working to resolve them. Happily,
I have found that I've been able to get through work for my other
classes quickly enough that the majority of my working hours can be
devoted to the project.

I have also written up a roadmap for the remainder of the semester,
which can be found in the "write_ups_etc" directory. 

Next week:

I will continue implementing, paying particular attention to
assembling the GA component and fixing some bugs that have cropped
up there.
