Week of 2/20/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I have made considerable progress on the debugging. The basic machinery is nearly
done, but some of the less important operators still need work. Specifically, I need
to make changes to the two "subsumption" operators, which, as their name suggests,
allow rules to subsume other rules that they generalize. I also need to work on the
"specify" operator, which takes an overly general rule and assigns values to its
attributes based on an input vector. There are also some memory leaks that I'm trying
to work through, but the output from Valgrind has not been particularly helpful.

As I mentioned in my email, I have been testing the LCS on data from the UCI Machine
Learning repository, which has been very helpful. However, I would like to start
experimenting with Erik's data as soon as possible. 

Next week:

I will finish dealing with the items listed above. Assuming the system doesn't
produce *terrible* results, I also need to start thinking about the proper approach
to data collection, and about what writing I should be doing. We can discuss all
this in our meeting on Friday.
