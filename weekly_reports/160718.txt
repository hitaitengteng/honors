Week of 7/18/16 (Week 8)

Summary:  I spent most of this week working on my presentation for
	  the CS talks on Thursday. After I had presented, I began
	  work on several functions for reading in actual data from
	  the post-processor. I had hoped to finish these by the
	  end of the week, but the preparations for the presentation
	  took longer than anticipated. That said, I made significant
	  progress on the functions, and they should not take long
	  to finish.

Goals:    Although my fellowship has ended, I still have to write up
	  a report for the Office of Student Fellowships and Research,
	  which I intend to start on soon.
