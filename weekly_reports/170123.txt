Week of 1/23/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I have continued work on implementing my LCS. As I noted in our meeting,
I have abandoned the Evolving Objects library after realizing that it
would be no less work to write an LCS using that code than it would be
to develop my own from scratch. I also figured that it would be easier
to understand and debug my own code.

A description of the LCS can be found in Crisp_LCS_Schema.txt in this
directory. The implementation uses five classes: Attribute, Rule,
Population, LCS, and Dataset. I have essentially finished the first
three, am mostly done with Dataset, and am currently trying to put
everything together in the LCS class.

Although I have been diligent about writing and running unit tests
as I have gone along, I am sure I will discover plenty more bugs
as the system starts to cohere. I'm also unsure of several implementation
choices I've made, such as the relatively meager use of pointers.
I may have to reconsider some of these.

Next week:

I will continue implementing. You suggested I start to think about
the different versions of the system that I will eventually
compare with one another, so I'll be sure to keep that in mind
as I work.

Lastly, I will write up a roadmap for the rest of the semester. I
believe you suggested I write one for the ideal scenario, and one
for the scenario where things don't pan out so well. I'll try to
do both.
