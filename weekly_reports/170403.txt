Week of 4/3/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I devoted nearly all of my time to writing, which was more than I intended.
However, I did make substantial progress. I have finished rough drafts of 
the introduction, background, and system design sections and am currently
editing them. They do not have all of the figures I hope to eventually
include, but I thought it best to just plow ahead with the writing and see
how much time I have for figures later. Anyhow, these are the only sections 
I think I can write without results.

Next week:

I plan to have finished my preliminary edits by tomorrow or Wednesday, at 
which point I will submit what I have to you for critique. Once I have
done that, I will begin the serious experimentation.
