Week of 3/06/17
Will Gantt

This week:

After our meeting, it became clear that my implementation of the LCS
differed considerably from your expectations. To implement the new fitness
schema and to make the necessary structural changes to what I have already
written will require fairly substantial revision. I began those revisions
this week.

Some of the major changes that I am making (apart from the fitness schema):

The original system:
	- One example is presented to the LCS at a time.
	- The GA operates only on those rules that correctly classify the
	  current example.
	- The population is empty when initialized.
	- One complete run of the LCS attempts to classify all examples.

The new system:
	- All of the data is presented to the LCS simultaneously.
	- The GA operates on the entire population.
	- The population is initialized with a random set of rules.
	- One complete run of the LCS attempts to classify all of the
	  examples in a single class.

Next week:

I will continue to overhaul the system, implementing the changes described
above.
