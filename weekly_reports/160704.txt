Week of 7/4/16 (Week 6)

Summary:  This week I spent probably too much time making improvements to my
	  random data functions, but they are working very well now. The
	  latter half of the week was mostly devoted to updating documentation
	  and to working on the function that finds the best modules in each
	  sequence (findBestModules). As of right now, this function isn't
	  working.

Goals:    First order of business is to get findBestModules working. After
	  that, I will implement the evaluation function. I want to get
	  the whole thing working on *some* data set -- whether real or
	  randomly generated -- before I leave. I talked with Clare about
	  using the PDGFRB data, but my plan right now is to run the
	  program on the random data (since I already have all of that set
	  up), then try it on the PDGFRB data if I have time. I also need
	  to start planning for my talk in a couple weeks.

Tuesday
	- Updated documentation of motif2.c, motif2.h, and Will_v2.0.c
	  and changed variable names in order to improve clarity.
	- Implemented an evaluation function for finding the best candidate
	  module along a genomic sequence, given a set of motifs.

Wednesday
	- Migrated randomData (generates a random motif library with a set of
	  instances of the motifs in a genomic sequence) and findBestModule
	  (which finds the best candidate module in a genomic sequence, given
	  a library of motifs) functions from Will_v2.0.c to motif2.c and added
	  to their documentation.
	- Worked on modifying randomData function so that it would generate
	  instances of motifs on multiple genomic sequences.
	- Attended biology talks.
	- Listened to Stephen Houser speak about code organization.
	- Spoke with Clare and Craig briefly about the arc of my project for the
	  remaining two weeks.

Thursday
	- Made modifications to various random data generation functions.
	- Attended CS talks. 
	- Ran into trouble with the findBestModules function and realized it
	  needed a complete overhaul in order to accommodate a new datatype
	  that I had made. Began on this overhaul.

Friday
	- Until now, nearly all of my code was in a single .c/.h file pair.
	  I spent a fair amount of time this morning breaking it up into
	  multiple files.
	- Something strange happened to the function that finds the best
	  candidate modules in each sequence (I get segfaults every time
	  I try to run it). I worked on debugging it for most of the day
	  and did make some progress, but there are still things wrong with
	  it. I hope to get this smoothed out soon so that I can work on
	  the more important stuff (the evaluation function).
