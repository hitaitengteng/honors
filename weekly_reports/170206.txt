Week of 2/6/17
Will Gantt

This week:

I have continued work on the LCS. I did my first trial run of the
whole system on some artificial data merely to see whether it would
run and without much of an eye toward the accuracy of the output.
Unfortunately, even for small numbers of generations, the program
segfaulted. 

I have resolved most of the design problems that I was worried
about last week, and have turned my focus toward more fine-grained
debugging with the help of Valgrind.

Next week:

I wrote a battery of unit tests a few weeks back for some of the more
basic functions of the LCS, which helped a good deal in the earlier 
phases of development. My goal for this week is to write similar tests
for the more complicated functions and to do some good debugging
using those tests.
