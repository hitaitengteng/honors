The following is my worst-case timeline for my honors project.
I have tried to keep in mind here that humans are terrible at
estimating just how bad the worst case can be.


Implementing & Testing:

Get a preliminary version of the LCS up and running.

Test the LCS on Erik's data and debug as necessary.

Write at least two variations on the initial implementation.

Test the variations and debug as necessary.

Compare the performance and output of the variations on Erik's

data. Document the results and try to explain them.

If the results suggest that one or more versions of the LCS
might be improved in a particular way, implement the improvements
and test again.

Writing:

Write the Results section: This section should compare the results
of the different versions with one another, and with Erik and Clare's
findings as well.

Write the Discussion and Conclusion sections: This should attempt to 
explain the results, as well as the shortcomings of the system.

Write the System Description section. This should include descriptions
of both the original implementation and the variations, and should also
lay out the experimental set-up.

Rewrite the Introduction section and write the abstract. This will 
largely be a revision of the "Chapter 2" I submitted first semester,
with some added background information.
