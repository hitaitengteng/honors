A description of the evaluation function written in

	GANTT_eval_v2.0.c


Description:

1) Before the evaluation function is called, the n best
   modules are determined in each sequence using a
   separate function that identifies modules using a
   sliding window.
2) Once the modules have been determined, the evaluation
   function is called.
3) The overall fitness of a bit string is determined by
   computing the fitness of the motifs corresponding to
   indices in the bit string marked with a '1'. For
   each such index, the function iterates over the sequences
   and, within the sequences, the best modules in that
   sequence. For each sequence, the score of the index
   is incremented by the score of the highest-scoring
   module in which the corresponding motif occurs. If the
   motif does not occur in any of the modules in the sequence,
   the score of the index is decremented by the score
   of the highest-scoring module in the sequence.
4) If an index of the bit string is marked with a '0', the
   score for that index is 0.
5) The fitness of the bit string is the sum of the scores
   of its indices.
