LCS design questions

1. What subset of the classifier population will the GA act on?
   
    I think the GA should act on [C], the set of consistently
    correct classifiers.

2. What should be the fitness metric?

   Clare has suggested odds ratio. I am curious how effective
   this would be compared to a simple metric like:

       (# correctly classified) / (# matches)

3. How should classifiers recommending conflicting actions
   be handled?

4. Should I start by implementing a vanilla LCS and then modify
   it to be fuzzy, or should I go straight for a fuzzy one?
